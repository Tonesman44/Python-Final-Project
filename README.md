## Challanges Faced - With Soulutions
Going into this project we had no experience with API's, HTML, or CSS. 
Right off the bat we decided to get the basic design of the website out of the way, so we found out how to write some basic HTML.
From there we wanted to style the welcome page, so we learned some simple CSS to clean up the page and make it look nicer.
Then we hit our first roadblock, the API.
Here we had no idea where to start and Rate My Professor didn't have any help on their website.
So we traversed github and found an API from awhile back from a user named Tisuela.  
From there it was smoothe sailing, until we found out the API can only generate 8 teachers max per search because the website has a "load more" feature.
In response to that, we pivoted and made a search bar on the website so you would focus on generating information for one teacher at a time.
In the end, we accomplished our idea, but we didn't get to polish it and make it look as cool as we wanted to. However, we learned a lot and I'm proud of what we accomplished!
