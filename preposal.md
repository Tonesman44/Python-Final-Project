1. Turtle Aim Trainer, stamp turtle randomly and the user clicks to score a point. (Includes acurracy and multiple difficulty levels depending on how fast and accurate you are)
2. Pokedex of Temple Teachers, would take information from rate my professor to get the ratings and qualities/strengths of picking that teacher.
