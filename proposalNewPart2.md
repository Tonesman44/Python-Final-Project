# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pokedex - The Temple University Region

Interactive Turtle Aim Trainer

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
Either:
A pokedex based off of Temple teachers showing their rate my professor and temple portal information.

An interactive turtle that acts as an aim trainer and increases in difficulty the better you do.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

If we do the pokedex then we will need to research how API's work. 

For Turtle we would have to research how to make it interactive. This will be interesting since all we've done with it before is draw things. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Partner is Jeffrey Cheung
His email is Tul61492@temple.edu
TA = Rahad Arman Nabid

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Interactive Turtle Aim Trainer: Atleast have a interactive turtle that appears and disappears

Pokedex - The Temple University Region: Atleast have a interface of menus to interact with

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Interactive Turtle Aim Trainer: Have multiple difficults and accuracy percentage

Pokedex: Have some teacher's information manually imported

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Interactive Turtle Aim Trainer: Polished animations, some graphics, score history, and maybe sound.

Pokedex: Have data from rate my professor automatically imported into our pokedex, things such as ratings, written reviews, and tags such as tough grader or note heavy.
This is what I have so far for those questions
Working on the last one now

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

No matter what the first step is either to research on turtles capabilities or use the links provided in canvas to look more into the pokedex. My partner and I discussed that we would do discord calls together and work on it at the same time. For this assignemnt I will be focusing on how to condense my code. A big problem I have right now is that my code always looks way too big. One skill I hope to develop is finding out how to transfer the data from rate my professor to the pokedex file. On the other hand, if we do the turtle idea then we have to develop an idea to make it interactive.
