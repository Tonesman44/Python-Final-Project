Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

First off we learned how to do basic HTML, CSS, and javascript to create the website. From there we decided to do a basic outline of what we want. So far, we have pictures of a couple teachers from temple that we got from the directory, and it also contains their names. Then, when you click those photos you get sent to their rate my professor page. In reality, our real goal is to have it so when you click their name, it would open a new page that pulls information from rate my professor and sets it up to look like a pokedex entry. However, before we do that, we have to figure out how to use the rate my professor API. Overall though, I'm happy with our progress and I'm glad we set up an outline for the website and learned how to use HTML and CSS!

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

As stated previously, we haven't learned how to fully use the API from rate my professor yet. We are going to dedicate this whole week to figuring it out and setting it up. If the API somehow doesn't work then our backup plan is to make a web scraper. Also, I was thinking of adding a searchbar instead of just clicking the photos but for right now I want to just focus on the API since we got the basic HTML and CSS out of the way.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

So far we don't have any major problems, but some tips of API's would be greatly appreciated.
